# Smart-Product-Calssfier
A simple C++ program that classifies products based on price and category, calculates tax, and outputs the final price with conditional logic.

# 🛍️ Product Tax Classification System

## Overview

This is a **beginner-friendly C++ console application** designed to help users classify products based on their price and category. The system calculates the applicable tax depending on the product type and outputs the final price after tax.

It serves as an educational project for understanding conditional logic, user input handling, and basic arithmetic operations in C++.

## ✅ Features

- 🏷️ **Price-Based Classification**  
  Products are automatically classified into High, Medium, or Low value based on their price.

- 📂 **Category Detection**  
  The user specifies the product category, and the system applies the correct tax rate based on that.

- 💰 **Tax Calculation**  
  Each category has a predefined tax percentage, and the final price is calculated accordingly.

- ⚙️ **Ternary Operator Logic**  
  Uses nested ternary operators to streamline final price computation.

- 🖥️ **Simple Console Interface**  
  Text-based interface suitable for beginners and small use cases.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Programming Language: `C++`  
- Concepts Covered:
  - Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
  - Ternary operator usage
  - User input handling (`cin`)
  - Logical operators
  - Basic arithmetic operations

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Educational tool for beginners learning C++ conditions and logic
- Prototype for product classification and tax calculation systems
- Practice project for students learning basic decision-making structures

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Compile the program using any C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio).
2. Run the executable in the terminal or command prompt.
3. Follow the prompts to enter the product name, price, and category.
4. The system will output the classification, applied tax, and final price.

## 📌 Future Improvements (Optional)

- Add a GUI interface for better usability  
- Store product data into a file for saving history  
- Allow admin to define tax rates dynamically  
- Support multiple products and generate invoices
